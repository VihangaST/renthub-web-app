A Full-stack Web App I built that transforms how Short-stay Rentals are managed — combining real-time property booking with predictive intelligence using Machine Learning.

Built for both Renters and Property Owners, the platform supports:
 🔹 Smooth property search and booking
 🔹 Dashboards for availability, pricing insights, and review analytics

🧠 What makes it smart?
I integrated ML models trained on platform-wide data, so even new listings get instant insights.


❓ “Am I underpricing my property?”

🔹 Price Prediction Model          💡 Suggests optimal pricing by comparing with similar successful listings.
 
 ❓ “Will this type of property be available next weekend?”

🔹 Occupancy Prediction Model      💡 Predicts availability based on booking trends.

 ❓ “How will guests likely rate this place?”

 🔹 Review Score Prediction Model   💡 Estimates review scores using features of similar properties.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
React • Flask • Tailwind CSS • MySQL • TensorFlow • Scikit-learn

Proud of this journey combining full-stack development with ML to solve real-world rental challenges.
